    <h3>Communication</h3>
    From day one our communication was on point, as soon as we were put into our groups we set up a Discord server and Gitlab. We chose Discord because it was easier to use, free, and most of us already had an account already set up. Discord also has the ability to handle voice chat so we could call into the group and have conference calls on the go. Although we didn’t end up making use of this feature

	The beginning of the Discord channel 

    <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/1A.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/>
    <br>
    Having communications, right from the get-go, set us up for a smooth start for the project
	We also had scrums every lesson we did try to have them everyday but due to the timetable constraints we weren’t always around Polytechnic, so we couldn’t follow agile principle 6 “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is a face-to-face conversation.”  
	in the case, we couldn’t make it we would usually give the team a quick update on the Discord channel. 
	Here we are talking about the user stories we had recently collected
 <br>
    <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/1B.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
    <br>
   	 We used other tools to communicate like the bug tracking system this was great because we could see what other members of the team were currently working on and what version of the software we were up to. This helped us organize our sprints weekly by saying that the tasks assigned would be completed by the end of the week. In some cases, our sprints went for two weeks but that was about the max amount of time we spent on something before asking for help.
	An image of the bug tracking website Roadmap
	 <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/1C.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/>
   <br>
   We would usually send files to each other via the Discord files and images channel this allowed us to keep the main channel clear of clutter and keep everything organized. The files posted here were not supposed to be included in the main project so they were not uploaded to the Gitlab for this reason
   <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/1D.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
   <br>
   This year communication was a primary focus, so I ended up sending what felt like chapters of text to the channel to keep everyone informed on either what I was doing or what went wrong. This turned out to be a lot of help because when we got back into class we didn’t have to spend 20 or so minutes discussing what had happened.
   <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/1E.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/>
   
  
   <br>
   <br>
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    We could have communicated a bit more with our Clients as this would have allowed us to add more to the project although we got a lot of work done considering we started from scratch.
     </div>
     <br>
  <div class="col-md-8">
	  <br></br>
    <h3>Leadership</h3>
     This Year I took more of a management and leadership role I had learnt from previous experiences that taking charge instead of just sitting there is definitely a better option I started out by getting our group to do a quick introductory talk just saying the first name and what they like to do, I did this so we would know each other's names. I then created a Discord group and added everyone so we had that channel open,
	<br>
	I wanted to have some sort of software to properly track what everyone was doing so we could provide good data for the mid and end project progress reports I decided to use mantis BT. An open source free bug and issue tracker that I ran on my personal servers. 
	<br>
	<img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/2A.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
    The best thing about this was that it was open source so I could easily make modifications to it to suit our needs I added a user stories Row so we could specify what was a User story
    <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/2B.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
    <br>
    Most of the team members used it after they got used to it. This made it great because we all knew who was working on what. In Week 2 I tried to organize the group by splitting it into to parts our frontend team and the backend team but this quickly changed after the initial version of the database was released. I also helped out on the front end side but I was trying to keep everything organized for the team.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    Looking back, I think I did a good job in leading our team. Making sure everyone was working on something or was going to do something as well as keeping good records on what had happened. If there was any self-advice I’d suggest to make sure to write down what happened in conversations and team scrums rather than trying to commit them to memory. </div>
    <br>
  <div class="col-md-8">
	  <br></br>
    <h3>Teamwork</h3>
    With the Bug tracking software and the weekly sprints I believe we communicated really well there were times when we didn’t know what team members were Woking on but this came down to them not entering it in to Mantis, The way we fixed this was just talk to them and ask them to add it so we knew what was happening<br>
    If we ever ran into an issue we would ask other members and they always seemed happy to help this helped a lot especially around learning the whole YII framework. 
    <br>
    An example of what really showed our teamwork was when Aidyn worked out how to use it and explained to me that we had a page generator built into the Framework named Gii
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/3A.PNG" width="700" height="400" alt=""/><br>
	    
	 This really ended up coming in handy as now we had an easy way to create views and CRUD fields. 
	I really enjoyed working in a team that communicated well and contributed to the project.


    <br>
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    If I was to try and improve anything it would be to make sure that we knew what the rest of the team members were doing in some cases, we were not sure of what someone was working on and if they could have been working on something more aligned with the user stories  </div>
  <div class="col-md-8">
	  <br></br>
    <h3>Time management</h3>
    I tried to attend the class as much as possible although due to other commitments id have to skip it which I found annoying because I always liked to do a scrum with the rest of the team members, I’d always ask the team later on the discord what happened. <br>
	When an issue arose I’d usually try to get to it as soon as possible. This was highly depended on what the issue was for example if it was a simple database import error then id gets to it within the day but if it was something more serious like the website being down then id get to it as soon as possible. 
	<br>
	When the Mantis site went down I spent about an hour trying to work out what went down and how to fix it. Because I had automated logging active it was only down for about an hour So I was able to get to it up and running pretty quickly.
<br>
   <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/4A.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
   Mantis BT also had a roadmap that allowed us to set up versions this let us plan our sprints around it, as one of our main goals was following an agile approach, in this case, we wanted to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software which is, in fact, the first Agile principle
   <br>
   <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/roadmap week 12.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
   <br>
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    I felt that I managed my time relatively well considering I had my other classes and commitments I was able to keep contributing to the project and keep everything online (for the most part) throughout the project.
     If I was to improve anything it would be devoting more time towards the project.  </div>
     
      <div class="col-md-8">
	  <br></br>
    <h3>Motivating self and others</h3>
    Throughout the project I was continually asking team members to add tickets to the bug tracker, so we could track the project. This worked out well because we were able to see common issue trends usually these were simple design mistakes.  <br>
    My motivation was from failing last semester so this year I went all out and put a lot more effort into this paper recording and collecting data on almost everything. I worked a lot more with the team and communicated with them on what I was doing. I tried to provide as much help as possible to all team members. Because of this, I am actually quite happy with what I achieved this semester.
    <br>
    
   
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    Looking back, I Think I did a pretty good job I definitely had the motivation with not wanting to repeat again and feel like I was able to keep the team motivated with showing them what they had done for the mid project report. Overall, I don’t have any improvement advice for this. <br></br></p></div>

          <h3>Week 1</h3>
          <p>This year I took on a new project called Semester tracker  this project was to allow the user to visually see the semester dates  assignment, due dates and public holidays, We first to get to know our fellow  team members, set up a git hub and get our communication channels working. We  added everyone to the new Discord server and put up the links to the GitHub.          
          <p>. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Next up we needed to get the original files for the current  project. We found it on her Github and got to work on getting it running. Once  we got it running we found numerous bugs and added them as bugs to the Github</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 2</h3>
          <p>At the start of this week we were about to start on  rewriting the whole project in PHP but then Elise recommend we look for a  project like yii, at first we were hesitant but got to work at looking for php  frameworks but got to work searching for a preferred framework.            
          <p>.<br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>By lesson 2 we had decided to ultimately go for the YII  framework. The next step was to start learning how to use YII we spent the rest  of this lesson doing this, I also got to work on preplanning the data base.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 3</h3>
          <p>Week 3 we organised ourselves into teams at the time there  were two teams a frontend and backend I took on the role of backend but also  acted as the manager for the project. My first task was to preplant the  database. I started looking at Elise&rsquo;s old project to get an idea of what we  needed. We also planned to go and see Adon our other client to discuss user  stories . Unfortunately I was unable to attend this meeting but got notes on  what happened.             
          <p>  <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          We needed to have a quick catch up with our Client but they were busy with other groups for the most of the lesson, We still hadn’t learned how to use the Yii framework so things were going slow, the data base was still in a predesign but without talking to Elise I couldn’t properly get a handle on what she wanted until we had met. I was able to get a rough design on paper done after class.</div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 4</h3>
          <p>When we got back from holiday we did a quick scrum I had made progress with the  YII framework in understanding the backend- frontend power of it and was amazed by it, I had also done some work in designing a database based off of the original site, admittedly I went away for the holiday so I didn’t get as much done as I wanted to. Over this week I worked with Ryan to combine all the plans of the database into one.</p><br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Myself and Ryan were still stuck on the database the main  issue being keeping it third form and relational we were also trying to learn  how to use the framework that Aidyn had got running, This class was more  dedicated to Aidyn running us through the steps of how to start the site  locally.</p>
</div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 5</h3>
          <p>This  lesson we finally completed the database all we had to do now was create it. I  started to prepare to my home server to set up a virtual webhost and set up a  subdomain on the DNS servers. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          Ryan  had sent me the draft database although I made several adjustments to this and  ended up uploading four different files to the database with multiple changes  per version. I ended up cutting a whole heap of redundant tables out because we  did not need them and simplified the other data, 
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 6</h3>
          <p>This week I decided I should get a live version of the site running I had to decide whether I should use the polytechnic network or use my own built on my domains, in the end I decided to work on my own server I had already set up the virtual server space and had room to add a subdomain I chose the home server as I had more control over it and could run it how I liked this also did add the responsibility of keeping the servers up but this was easy enough.  <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>After a week of issues regarding DNS issues database  permission issues and virtual server connection problems I was able to get  the site live, this was the first time the  new site was live although I had to make  more improvements regarding the database to stabilise some random data values</p>
, 
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 7</h3>
          <p>This week we made massive strides in progress I had a final version of the database and updated the site to use the newest versions of code I also updated out Go button to link directly to the Login screen once that was done I helped James and Aiden work on the Login screens connecctons to the database I was originally going to have to make a new table as it was not working it turns out James was doing it correctly but was just referencing the wrong table once that was fixed we were able to log in and the site would remember old users. Ryan was able to show Jamie how to use YII rather than write the page manually.

		We also had a major issue with the Live version. The Bugtracking site was down and I didn’t make backups for an easy restore the site was down for around an hour before I found the logs I had a “6” in a command it must of happened when I was updating the site to the newest version.
		I had to add some more tables for Jamie's ticket system although he was just back from his sickness so he hadn’t made much progress we were ready to help. Ryan had now created all the data inputs using the Yii framework so we could now add People, semesters, Class’s, and assignments  
 <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Unfortunately, I was  unable to attend this day as I was called to an urgent meeting although I  was working on generating dummy data for a  more realistic simulation of the site being live while also working with Ryan  to set up automated testing. James was also working on testing all of our input  fields to see if it could be broken easily. Jamie was adding preselected  options for the leave tickets system rather than having to add it manually.</p>
</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 8</h3>
          <p>This  lesson I helped Aidyn and James work on the login system for students and  lectures I had to try and explain that the permissions row on the person table  was used to define whether it is a student or a lecture trying to login we  attempted to use the built in Gii but it didn&rsquo;t work.. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          In  this lesson we discussed changing the way person is made and the possibility of  adding an extra table for authentication but after going through the YouTube  tutorial again Aidyn noticed that we were still pointing towards a user table  in a config rather than the persons table. I also did a lot of set up on my  portfolio,

          <h3>Week 9</h3>
          <p>This  week I was pretty busy with other assignments I was staying at polytechnic from  around 9:00 am to 10:00 pm each night I was able to fix the lockout that I had  accidentally caused by attempting the Server password incorrectly too many  times. I checked up on the rest of the team and they said they were at work on  the API. <br>

          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          I  have to admit not much happened in class this lesson we mostly just worked on  our portfolios and were fixing the odd bugs in the data base I had to make a  quick fix to the Database import as it would throw an error ever time we went  to set it up on a new machine this was due to an &ldquo;Add&rdquo; statement in the wrong  position,

          <h3>Week 10</h3>
          <p>Aidyn  had a meeting with Adon on behalf of the group to show him the new API he had  been working on, he asked that we create some way to selectively pull data from  the data base and create CSV import options I took a look at the CSV file and  noticed it had some data we currently could not handle and got to work and  reworking the backend. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          Things  had become complicated, it being so close to the end of semester work and other  assignments began to build up, I wanted to get the backend database reworked  but sadly didn&rsquo;t have enough time for it. I was able to come up with a few  options on how we could rework it but I&rsquo;d need to some more time to check all  the possibility&rsquo;s .

          <h3>Week 11</h3>
          <p>After  I met with the group I decided to go with the in my mind best solution to this  issue I didn&rsquo;t want to affect the rest of the teams work. Since most of the  site is auto generated by Gii from the database there was really no way that I  could make the required adjustments to it without breaking anything. I  communicated this in advance with the team to give them a heads up. I also made  some major changes around the course we now take the day of the week in to  account when we want to make a new course. This will show up on the semester  dates page.<br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          I  was working with other team members this lesson guiding them through the new  database design and what has been changed what will need to be added and what  is already linked. Near the end of this class we just got together and started  work on the technical report I took over the formation of it and wrote in how  to set up a live server. We also added a list of all the technologies used  along with the version.

          <h3>Week 12</h3>
          <p>We  are pretty much finished now I asked the members present to close any remaining  issues and remined the team to fill out the personal evaluations, I sent out  the individual stats to each team member this contained the bugs they managed  to resolve and an overall view of how well we did over the course of this  project. I also updated the Live version to the most recent working local  version. My main concern was keeping the site in a stable yet recent version.  This meant no obvious bugs or errors. I quickly tested the site and found  nothing obvious.. <br>
