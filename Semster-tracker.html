          <h3>Week 1</h3>
          <p> This year I took on a new project called Semester tracker this project was to allow the user to visually see the semester dates assignment, due dates and public holidays. I was assigned to take management and handle the back end of the project Ryan was helping me with the initial plans. Our team was able to get an initial version from our client Elise to get an idea of what she wanted. We soon realized that it was easier to restart from the beginning with a framework we went away with the task to find a framework. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
         We came back to class a decided framework called “YII” this was a powerful piece of software that allowed us to quickly set up a website and generate CRUD enabled pages directly from the site itself this cut down the amount of work to be done by at least 80%. Unfortunately, we were getting close to the holiday break so we decided what should do over this break was to try and learn the framework.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 2</h3>
          <p> When we got back from holiday we did a quick scrum I had made progress with the  YII framework in understanding the backend- frontend power of it and was amazed by it, I had also done some work in designing a database based off of the original site, admittedly I went away for the holiday so I didn’t get as much done as I wanted to. Jamie had also done planning work on the database he was supposed to be working on the front end but designed a database in access, this was a problem so I needed to find a better way to set up team communication to prevent duplication in work. Over this week I worked with Ryan to combine all the plans into one.<br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
         This week I had completed the newest design on the database in a third form version and no duplications of data, I checked up on the front end team and Aiden had made some progress in getting YII initially setup although none of us really knew how it worked, we were happy we had something we then tasked everyone with tickets using my ticket system (mantis BT) set up on my home server this way we could track, assign and report issues.  I got Ryan to do the initial set up of the database. And assigned tasks to each member Jamie was to work on a leave application page Aiden was to work on a table displaying the semesters and James was working on the login pages 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 3</h3>
          <p> This week we had a database although it required a few improvements Ryan had done a great Job and set up a basic database I decided to remove some tables that weren’t really doing anything so I spent some time on simplifying it I removed both the student and lecturer tables and changed some data types to align more with what we needed. As for the rest of the team, Aiden had succeeded in displaying a table it was hardcoded data but that was because we still had to finish the database but it was relatively easy to implement.  <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          Not much happening in this week I made a few more adjustments to the database, and got it up and running and Aiden was able to link in data directly we then found a bug in which there is no data the site will throw a PHP SQL error this is an easy fix.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 4</h3>
          <p> This week I decided I should get a live version of the site running I had to decide whether I should use the polytechnic network or use my own built on my domains, in the end I decided to work on my own server as I had more control over it and could run it how I liked this also did add the responsibility of keeping the servers up but this was easy enough.  <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
         After a week of issues regarding DNS issues database permission issues and virtual server connection problems I was able to get  the site live, this was the first time the new site was live although I had to make more improvements regarding the database as I had to add some more tables for Jamie's ticket system although he was just back from his sickness so he hadn’t made much progress we were ready to help. Ryan had now created all the data inputs using the Yii framework so we could now add People, semesters, Class’s, and assignments  
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 5</h3>
          <p> This week we made massive strides in progress I had a final version of the database and updated the site to use the newest versions of code I also updated out Go button to link directly to the Login screen once that was done I helped James and Aiden work on the Login screens connecctons to the database I was originally going to have to make a new table as it was not working it turns out James was doing it correctly but was just referencing the wrong table once that was fixed we were able to log in and the site would remember old users. Ryan was able to show Jamie how to use YII rather than write the page manually. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          unfortunately, I was unable to attend this day as I was called to an urgent meeting although I  was working on generating dummy data for a more realistic simulation of the site being live while also working with Ryan to set up automated testing. James was also working on testing all of our input fields to see if it could be broken easily. Jamie was adding preselected options for the leave tickets system rather than having to add it manually,
