      <p>The task of this project was to build a web app that allowed users to see the upcomming semester dates, this allows the user to find out important information such as public holidays, upcoming assignments and the current week of the semester<br>
		  <br>With a tool like this it should help both students and lectures plan out there semeseter more easily without the stress of forgotten dates</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>To summarise this project I have to say that it has been a difficult one. This class requires you to think differently from how we have been taught so far, making use of the Agile principles and different technologies was a huge step in the right direction as far as learning goes. The use of the Yii framework accelerated this project faster than any manual way of coding it would have been. From now on I’m going to look for newer technologies and be open to learning them rather than just sticking to what I know.  </p>

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    From day one our communication was on point, as soon as we were put into our groups we set up a Discord server and Gitlab. We chose Discord because it was easier to use, free, and most of us already had an account already set up. Discord also has the ability to handle voice chat so we could call into the group and have conference calls on the go. Although we didn’t end up making use of this feature

	The beginning of the Discord channel 

    <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/1A.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/>
    <br>
    Having communications, right from the get-go, set us up for a smooth start for the project
	We also had scrums every lesson we did try to have them everyday but due to the timetable constraints we weren’t always around Polytechnic, so we couldn’t follow agile principle 6 “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is a face-to-face conversation.”  
	in the case, we couldn’t make it we would usually give the team a quick update on the Discord channel. 
	Here we are talking about the user stories we had recently collected
 <br>
    <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/1B.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
    <br>
   	 We used other tools to communicate like the bug tracking system this was great because we could see what other members of the team were currently working on and what version of the software we were up to. This helped us organize our sprints weekly by saying that the tasks assigned would be completed by the end of the week. In some cases, our sprints went for two weeks but that was about the max amount of time we spent on something before asking for help.

	 <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/1C.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/>
   <br>
   We would usually send files to each other via the Discord files and images channel this allowed us to keep the main channel clear of clutter and keep everything organized. The files posted here were not supposed to be included in the main project so they were not uploaded to the Gitlab for this reason
   <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/1D.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
   <br>
   This year communication was a primary focus, so I ended up sending what felt like chapters of text to the channel to keep everyone informed on either what I was doing or what went wrong. This turned out to be a lot of help because when we got back into class we didn’t have to spend 20 or so minutes discussing what had happened.

   <br>
   <br>
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    We could have communicated a bit more with our Clients as this would have allowed us to add more to the project although we got a lot of work done considering we started from scratch.
     </div>

    <h3>Leadership</h3>
     This Year I took more of a management and leadership role I had learnt from previous experiences that taking charge instead of just sitting there is definitely a better option I started out by getting our group to do a quick introductory talk just saying the first name and what they like to do, I did this so we would know each other's names. I then created a Discord group and added everyone so we had that channel open,
	<br>
	I wanted to have some sort of software to properly track what everyone was doing so we could provide good data for the mid and end project progress reports I decided to use mantis BT. An open source free bug and issue tracker that I ran on my personal servers. 
	<br>
	<img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/2A.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
    The best thing about this was that it was open source so I could easily make modifications to it to suit our needs I added a user stories Row so we could specify what was a User story
    <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/2B.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
    <br>
    Most of the team members used it after they got used to it. This made it great because we all knew who was working on what. In Week 2 I tried to organize the group by splitting it into to parts our frontend team and the backend team but this quickly changed after the initial version of the database was released. I also helped out on the front end side but I was trying to keep everything organized for the team.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    Looking back, I think I did a good job in leading our team. Making sure everyone was working on something or was going to do something as well as keeping good records on what had happened. If there was any self-advice I’d suggest to make sure to write down what happened in conversations and team scrums rather than trying to commit them to memory. </div>
    <br>
  <div class="col-md-8">
	  <br></br>
    <h3>Teamwork</h3>
    With the Bug tracking software and the weekly sprints I believe we communicated really well there were times when we didn’t know what team members were Woking on but this came down to them not entering it in to Mantis, The way we fixed this was just talk to them and ask them to add it so we knew what was happening<br>
    If we ever ran into an issue we would ask other members and they always seemed happy to help this helped a lot especially around learning the whole YII framework. 
    <br>
    An example of what really showed our teamwork was when Aidyn worked out how to use it and explained to me that we had a page generator built into the Framework named Gii
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/3A.PNG" width="700" height="400" alt=""/><br>
	    
	 This really ended up coming in handy as now we had an easy way to create views and CRUD fields. 
	I really enjoyed working in a team that communicated well and contributed to the project.


    <br>
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    If I was to try and improve anything it would be to make sure that we knew what the rest of the team members were doing in some cases, we were not sure of what someone was working on and if they could have been working on something more aligned with the user stories  </div>
  <div class="col-md-8">
	  <br></br>
    <h3>Time management</h3>
    I tried to attend the class as much as possible although due to other commitments id have to skip it which I found annoying because I always liked to do a scrum with the rest of the team members, I’d always ask the team later on the discord what happened. <br>
	When an issue arose I’d usually try to get to it as soon as possible. This was highly depended on what the issue was for example if it was a simple database import error then id gets to it within the day but if it was something more serious like the website being down then id get to it as soon as possible. 
	<br>
	When the Mantis site went down I spent about an hour trying to work out what went down and how to fix it. Because I had automated logging active it was only down for about an hour So I was able to get to it up and running pretty quickly.
<br>
   <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/4A.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
   Mantis BT also had a roadmap that allowed us to set up versions this let us plan our sprints around it, as one of our main goals was following an agile approach, in this case, we wanted to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software which is, in fact, the first Agile principle
   <br>
   <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/roadmap week 12.PNG" width="650" height="400" alt=""/><br>
   <br>
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    I felt that I managed my time relatively well considering I had my other classes and commitments I was able to keep contributing to the project and keep everything online (for the most part) throughout the project.
     If I was to improve anything it would be devoting more time towards the project.  </div>
     
      <div class="col-md-8">
	  <br></br>
    <h3>Motivating self and others</h3>
    Throughout the project I was continually asking team members to add tickets to the bug tracker, so we could track the project. This worked out well because we were able to see common issue trends usually these were simple design mistakes.  <br>
    My motivation was from failing last semester so this year I went all out and put a lot more effort into this paper recording and collecting data on almost everything. I worked a lot more with the team and communicated with them on what I was doing. I tried to provide as much help as possible to all team members. Because of this, I am actually quite happy with what I achieved this semester.
    <br>
    
   
    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    Looking back, I Think I did a pretty good job I definitely had the motivation with not wanting to repeat again and feel like I was able to keep the team motivated with showing them what they had done for the mid project report. Overall, I don’t have any improvement advice for this. <br></br></p></div>

        <h3>New Technology’s</h3>
        <p>When we first started this project it was very tempting to make a normal HTML page with some JavaScript pretty standard and easy. Since we didn’t know PHP we didn’t want to take the risk in learning in. Before we got started we talked to Elise she suggested we use a web framework such as YII,
          <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TA1.PNG" width="600" height="400" alt=""/> <br>
          <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TA2.PNG" width="600" height="400" alt=""/>
          <br>
           To me, this looked very daunting I had never used a framework before let alone a PHP one but was willing to give it a go. We got to work trying to learn what it was and how to get it to work, we decided it was better to hold of the project until we had an understanding so of how it worked. <br>
          After the holiday Aidyn had started work on the project by creating the initial template files for Yii that come with it we quickly found out how powerful and cool the framework did not only do it give us a nice-looking template, but it also had a built-in page called Gii that Generated the View pages and Crud controllers directly from the database.
          <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TA3.PNG" width="600" height="400" alt=""/> <br>
          This is by far the quickest way to get the site running while maintaining a good look. It would have taken a lot more time if we had gone with the original idea of doing it all manually. Frameworks have changed my whole mindset on how to do things. I was also able to pick up some new skills for working with PHP along the way and can understand how layouts work within the directory. We did the start off with a slow start but quickly caught up with the rest of the teams once we knew what we were doing. 
			<br>
		We also had to learn map a web framework with all the necessary tools to run a local site this saved us time because we didn’t have to copy our files to something like the Kate server every time we wanted to test something I recognised a lot of the things already here such as PHP Myadmin and the Apache web server so I was used to it within a few hours. <br>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>My Roles</h3>
        <p>This year I chose to work more on the backend and management side of the project, the first task was making a draft of the database all I had to go on was the database found in Elise’s old files which didn’t really help too much I decided it would be better to start from scratch and design the database in SQL using the standard InnoDB engine the first version of the Database was a scrawed version of notes on some paper.
          <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB1.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt=""/><br>
          The database then gradually changed form and soon enough its first version was ready Although as you can see it had a lot of redundant data here and there was some more planning work to go into it before it could be fixed 
          <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB2.PNG" width="627" height="909" alt=""/> <br></br>
          I ended up removing three tables of the database because they were not required and could easily be made redundant if we were to keep them in it would have just been more work to have a separate step, so I decided to differentiate students from lectures by adding a permissions row into the Person table. From here we could easily just run a query on that to determine the account type we wanted. We later used this change to hide certain tabs from students so that students could not add course’s etc 
          <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB3.PNG" width="560" height="373" alt=""/><br>
          This was the final form of the Person table as you can see we also had an auth key and access Token these are a backend security measure that allows the site to remember the user data so that it is easier to log in next time. The access token is generated automatically making it a safe way to keep the user information while keeping the site as easy to use as possible.
          <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB4.PNG" width="600" height="400" alt=""/> <br>
          Near the end of the project, Adon asked for a CSV file to be imported but the Database was not set up for this and I didn’t want to just do a “quick fix” as suggested by a team member for me to keep the database normalized it had to not allow null data. As nulls are negatively viewed from the perspective of database normalization. The idea is that if a value can be nothing, then you really should split that out into another sparse table such that you don't require rows for items which have no value.
          <br>
          For me to do this I was going to have to break some of the front end views Luckily they are for the most part generated automatically so we didn’t have to worry about it too much. I had to Ideas one was to just add the data to a person and generate random data if the data was null. This is not a good design idea but would have been faster to implement or option two, the one I went with was to create new tables and link the person to them this way we could have as many contacts per person as we want and also add important student information if they were a past student. While I was adding it I did some extra work around adding a days table this allowed the courses to be set to certain days and displayed in the semester views tab.
		  In the end, the data bae ended up looking something like this.
		  <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB5.PNG" width="600" height="400" alt=""/>
       <br>
       At the end I was happy with the end result It was a fully normalized third form database. With the ability to be expanded easily I kept each version of the database so any future groups could pick up on it easily.
       <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB6.PNG" width="665" height="340" alt=""/>
       <br>
       I could have had better naming conventions here but all anyone really needs is the Complete one
	The second half of my Job was server management and host management we had to a host a live version of our site somewhere I had a choice of either talking to the BIT OP team to open a space for the site or I could use my home network both were good options and had high-speed connections. 
        <br>
        I decided to run everything off of my home servers since then I had full control over them and knew they were running the adequate servers to host reliably. First was to set up a virtual host on the network. The server is running Wamp a service similar to wamp but is built specifically for windows machines in order to host something I had to edit my httpd.conf file in apache this me to specify a file alias and activate virtual hosting
        
        <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB7.PNG" width="700" height="410" alt=""/>
        <br>
        The next file I had to edit was the hosts file the host's file is a windows file found usually in Windows\Systems32\drivers\etc it is a file that contains the mappings of IP addresses to hostnames for TCP/IP connections. Once I've copied the Semester trackers Root folder to the virtual host's folder I had to create the mapping
        <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB8.PNG" width="691" height="465" alt=""/>
        <br>
        As you can see I run quite a few services including a mail server that was used for when someone forgot their password on Mantis BT. You can also see the new see track subdomain appended on to the main domain address. We are running both IPV4 and IPV6 addressing schemes. We now have a local connection for the computer but it still won't connect to the internet yet the next step was setting up port forwarding to forward incoming clients to the address 
        <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB10.PNG" width="475" height="153" alt=""/> <br>
        As you can see in the image above we set up a static routing policy for DHCP so that the server will always be given the same IP address for good measure I set the IP address out of the normal addressing range 192.168.1.81 this prevents any other mac address being assigned it in case the static DHCP address fails.
        <br>
        The last part of work on this network is to set up the port forwarding, this will forward any clients requesting access to a certain port from outside the network to be forwarded to the IP address set in this case it will be forwarded to my Server that will then forward it to the correct web page.
        <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB9.PNG" width="606" height="497" alt=""/>
        <br>
        The last part is setting up a DNS server I don’t run my own DNS server so I had to use a host Namecheap provide free DNSing to their users and update the data almost instantly so it was an easy choice I logged into my account and added a new A record an A record maps a domain name to the IP address (IPv4) of the computer hosting the domain. Simply put, an A record is used to find the IP address of a computer connected to the internet from a name.
        <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB11.PNG" width="600" height="400" alt=""/>
        <br>
        Once this was set up I had to wait 20 or so minutes this so the DNS server can send the DNS updates to other DNS servers around the world. After that the server was Live I did have some issues defining the location of the root folder but this was due to me not specifying that the subfolder was named “web” 
        <br>
        Apart from the management work specified on the professional proficiency I also did a few tweaks on the Web app itself I needed to make sure that the database had the correct access passwords to the Web servers database I found an issue in where the site would throw an access denied error if it tried to use root as the user. This as because the SQL server used a much more complex password for the root user. So I set up a new user named semroot with the password of root and edited the db.conf file. This had to be done with each site version update.
        <img src="images/portfolio/Semester tracker/TB12.PNG" width="858" height="294" alt=""/>
        <br>
        Another fix I had to make was the Go Button at first its leads back to the YII welcome page this wasn’t good since it gave all guests backend information on the network I made two changes to this one was a fix for the live version and one as for the local.

        At one point in the project the Entire Mantis site went down I was alerted right and checked the site to confirm sure enough the site was down. This was bad because if any team members wanted to post an update or ticket they could not. This could have been seen as a downside to running things at home but this error could have just as easily happened on any server, it was a 503 error which really doesn’t help as all it means is “service unavailable”. I had to remote directly into my server to check the logs and found the issue straight away.

        <br>
        It was a 6 in a configuration file I must have accidentally pressed it when I remoted in to update the site and clicked save when I closed all files I removed the ‘6’ and it started to work again emergency everted.
        <br>
        As a form of collaboration we worked on GitLab this allowed us to easily share work with each other and see who was committing work.

        <br>
        We could have used branches but found that we hardly ever worked on pages that someone else was working on at the same time. We had one merge error this was due to someone not pulling before attempting to commit their work. But it was easily fixed by replacing the working code with the broken code while also removing the Git Syntax.

        <h2>TimeLine</h2>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 1</h3>
          <p>This year I took on a new project called Semester tracker  this project was to allow the user to visually see the semester dates  assignment, due dates and public holidays, We first to get to know our fellow  team members, set up a git hub and get our communication channels working. We  added everyone to the new Discord server and put up the links to the GitHub.          
          <p>. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Next up we needed to get the original files for the current  project. We found it on her Github and got to work on getting it running. Once  we got it running we found numerous bugs and added them as bugs to the Github</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 2</h3>
          <p>At the start of this week we were about to start on  rewriting the whole project in PHP but then Elise recommend we look for a  project like yii, at first we were hesitant but got to work at looking for php  frameworks but got to work searching for a preferred framework.            
          <p>.<br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>By lesson 2 we had decided to ultimately go for the YII  framework. The next step was to start learning how to use YII we spent the rest  of this lesson doing this, I also got to work on preplanning the data base.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 3</h3>
          <p>Week 3 we organised ourselves into teams at the time there  were two teams a frontend and backend I took on the role of backend but also  acted as the manager for the project. My first task was to preplant the  database. I started looking at Elise&rsquo;s old project to get an idea of what we  needed. We also planned to go and see Adon our other client to discuss user  stories . Unfortunately I was unable to attend this meeting but got notes on  what happened.             
          <p>  <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          We needed to have a quick catch up with our Client but they were busy with other groups for the most of the lesson, We still hadn’t learned how to use the Yii framework so things were going slow, the data base was still in a predesign but without talking to Elise I couldn’t properly get a handle on what she wanted until we had met. I was able to get a rough design on paper done after class.</div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 4</h3>
          <p>When we got back from holiday we did a quick scrum I had made progress with the  YII framework in understanding the backend- frontend power of it and was amazed by it, I had also done some work in designing a database based off of the original site, admittedly I went away for the holiday so I didn’t get as much done as I wanted to. Over this week I worked with Ryan to combine all the plans of the database into one.</p><br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Myself and Ryan were still stuck on the database the main  issue being keeping it third form and relational we were also trying to learn  how to use the framework that Aidyn had got running, This class was more  dedicated to Aidyn running us through the steps of how to start the site  locally.</p>
</div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 5</h3>
          <p>This  lesson we finally completed the database all we had to do now was create it. I  started to prepare to my home server to set up a virtual webhost and set up a  subdomain on the DNS servers. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          Ryan  had sent me the draft database although I made several adjustments to this and  ended up uploading four different files to the database with multiple changes  per version. I ended up cutting a whole heap of redundant tables out because we  did not need them and simplified the other data, 
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 6</h3>
          <p>This week I decided I should get a live version of the site running I had to decide whether I should use the polytechnic network or use my own built on my domains, in the end I decided to work on my own server I had already set up the virtual server space and had room to add a subdomain I chose the home server as I had more control over it and could run it how I liked this also did add the responsibility of keeping the servers up but this was easy enough.  <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>After a week of issues regarding DNS issues database  permission issues and virtual server connection problems I was able to get  the site live, this was the first time the  new site was live although I had to make  more improvements regarding the database to stabilise some random data values</p>
, 
          </p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 7</h3>
          <p>This week we made massive strides in progress I had a final version of the database and updated the site to use the newest versions of code I also updated out Go button to link directly to the Login screen once that was done I helped James and Aiden work on the Login screens connecctons to the database I was originally going to have to make a new table as it was not working it turns out James was doing it correctly but was just referencing the wrong table once that was fixed we were able to log in and the site would remember old users. Ryan was able to show Jamie how to use YII rather than write the page manually.

		We also had a major issue with the Live version. The Bugtracking site was down and I didn’t make backups for an easy restore the site was down for around an hour before I found the logs I had a “6” in a command it must of happened when I was updating the site to the newest version.
		I had to add some more tables for Jamie's ticket system although he was just back from his sickness so he hadn’t made much progress we were ready to help. Ryan had now created all the data inputs using the Yii framework so we could now add People, semesters, Class’s, and assignments  
 <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Unfortunately, I was  unable to attend this day as I was called to an urgent meeting although I  was working on generating dummy data for a  more realistic simulation of the site being live while also working with Ryan  to set up automated testing. James was also working on testing all of our input  fields to see if it could be broken easily. Jamie was adding preselected  options for the leave tickets system rather than having to add it manually.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 8</h3>
          <p>This  lesson I helped Aidyn and James work on the login system for students and  lectures I had to try and explain that the permissions row on the person table  was used to define whether it is a student or a lecture trying to login we  attempted to use the built in Gii but it didn&rsquo;t work.. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          In  this lesson we discussed changing the way person is made and the possibility of  adding an extra table for authentication but after going through the YouTube  tutorial again Aidyn noticed that we were still pointing towards a user table  in a config rather than the persons table. I also did a lot of set up on my  portfolio,

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 9</h3>
          <p>This  week I was pretty busy with other assignments I was staying at polytechnic from  around 9:00 am to 10:00 pm each night I was able to fix the lockout that I had  accidentally caused by attempting the Server password incorrectly too many  times. I checked up on the rest of the team and they said they were at work on  the API. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          I  have to admit not much happened in class this lesson we mostly just worked on  our portfolios and were fixing the odd bugs in the data base I had to make a  quick fix to the Database import as it would throw an error ever time we went  to set it up on a new machine this was due to an &ldquo;Add&rdquo; statement in the wrong  position, 
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 10</h3>
          <p>Aidyn  had a meeting with Adon on behalf of the group to show him the new API he had  been working on, he asked that we create some way to selectively pull data from  the data base and create CSV import options I took a look at the CSV file and  noticed it had some data we currently could not handle and got to work and  reworking the backend. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          Things  had become complicated, it being so close to the end of semester work and other  assignments began to build up, I wanted to get the backend database reworked  but sadly didn&rsquo;t have enough time for it. I was able to come up with a few  options on how we could rework it but I&rsquo;d need to some more time to check all  the possibility&rsquo;s . 
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 11</h3>
          <p>After  I met with the group I decided to go with the in my mind best solution to this  issue I didn&rsquo;t want to affect the rest of the teams work. Since most of the  site is auto generated by Gii from the database there was really no way that I  could make the required adjustments to it without breaking anything. I  communicated this in advance with the team to give them a heads up. I also made  some major changes around the course we now take the day of the week in to  account when we want to make a new course. This will show up on the semester  dates page.<br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          I  was working with other team members this lesson guiding them through the new  database design and what has been changed what will need to be added and what  is already linked. Near the end of this class we just got together and started  work on the technical report I took over the formation of it and wrote in how  to set up a live server. We also added a list of all the technologies used  along with the version.

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 12</h3>
          <p>We  are pretty much finished now I asked the members present to close any remaining  issues and remined the team to fill out the personal evaluations, I sent out  the individual stats to each team member this contained the bugs they managed  to resolve and an overall view of how well we did over the course of this  project. I also updated the Live version to the most recent working local  version. My main concern was keeping the site in a stable yet recent version.  This meant no obvious bugs or errors. I quickly tested the site and found  nothing obvious.. <br>
