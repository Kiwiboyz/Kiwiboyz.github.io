						<h3>Whats the project?</h3>
					  	We picked up this project about four weeks after everyone else had already started so we
					  	were already at a disadvantage. not to mention the project being drastically out of date
					  	and using old technologies it was like trying to sort out cables for a network without
					  	unplugging anything.

					  	<br><br>
						The project was supposed to be an easy system to allow admins to enter customer data in
						and show what that customer had ordered and when they wanted it delivered it even featured an
						integrated map that allowed the admin to see who the closest driver was to the drop off
						location.

						<h3>Summary</h3>
				  	<p>
					  	In the end we had just fixed most of the previous errors and changed all the Agile code to Java
					  	this still wasn't enough for release we even had a whole new site in the making. with a fresh modern
					  	look that was user friendly and responsive
 
					  	<br><br>
						unfortunately we ran out of time and did not get to integrate the new site which is what I primarily worked on the site was added to the git repository so that hopefully a future team can take over and finish what was left of our work.
						<br><br>
						All in all, I feel we did a great job considering out circumstances and issues we had along the way
						I really enjoyed working with the team I had and hope to work with them again in the future the next
						project will be completed.

						<h3>How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</h3>
						
						We never had any group meetings outside of class maybe this might have helped us in finishing the project since one of the biggest issues we had was working out what we were supposed to be happening. 
						<br><br>
						We often had a quick scrum when we met up in class but as far as meetings went that was it.
						 <br><br>
						<h5>Rating: 2/5</h5>
						
						<br>
						<h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
						
						By using slack we ended up communicating better and were able to work out what each of us were doing. 
					</div>
					
					
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<h3>How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?</h3>
						
						Very well we had a slack channel open from the start and id always try and get around to everyone in the group to see what was happening and what had been done, also to show them the progress I had made on the new site layout we did pretty well for communications. Even though we weren’t always sure on what we were supposed to be doing
						<br><br>
						<h5>Rating: 4/5</h5>
						<br>
						<h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
						Improvements could include having more conversations in real life rather than just online chat channels next project I will be doing more of that
					</div>

				
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<h3>How well did you document your work throughout the project?</h3>
						
						After each class Id usually make a quick voice to text memo on my phone this was helpful in creating the portfolio at the end although if I had just done the portfolio from the start it would have saved me much more time. I also had notes on scraps of paper that seem to have disintegrated at the bottom of my bag. We did have a Trello bored that we used to track some of the big tasks.
						<br><br>
						<h5>Rating: 3/5</h5>
						<br>
						<h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
						Some improvements could be documenting everything from the start and rather than scraps of paper lying around just add them to a notes section of the Trello bored 
					</div>
					
				
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<h3>How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements?</h3>
						
						 At the start not well, when we got told we had to decipher and fix a whole heap of bugs and issues none of us were happy about it especially because we had just lost four weeks because of a client that refused to respond to any communications.  We wanted to just start the project from scratch with a clean plate which I still believe would have been easier but instead were tasked to fix and repair the non-functioning old system that was significantly out of date and using technologies we had not been trained to use. After the first half of the semester we got better with handling problems and opted to fix them straight away rather than leave them for later.
						<br><br>
						<h5>Rating: 2/5</h5>
						<br>
						<h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
						Some improvements for me would be entering a project with an open mind but due to the issues we faced it wasn’t entirely under our control

						<h3>What is the overall quality of your code like?</h3>
						
						<p>
						I believe that the quality of my code was at a professional standard it was easy to read and comprehensible everything was well commented and even an untrained person was able to understand what was happening to an extent 
						<br><br>
						<h5>Rating: 5/5</h5>
						<br>
						<h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
						Improvements could include less empty space in my code 
						</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-12">
						<h3>How well did you follow best practices in development?</h3>
						
						
						<p>I did my Best to follow the best practices but sometimes the best practices may not be the right practices there are several practices in the industry that tend to keep with the old way of doing things when there are much more new and modern ways to achieve these goals and they usually take less time and perform better overall  
						<br><br>
						<h5>Rating: 3/5</h5>
						<br>
						<h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
						Recommendations could include explaining why the way develop may be better than the way everyone is used to there’s always more room for improvement and always something new to learn
						</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-12">
						<h3>How well did you use appropriate version control?</h3>
						
						<p>I admit I personally didn’t do a good job at version control. But the rest of my team did you see while they were working on changing the code to java from Agile and fixing some backend errors I was tasked with making the whole new website templates so there was no need for anyone to access the work I was doing until the final stages of merging our work together. Until that stage was reached we decided it was better not to have any website versioning. 
						<br><br>
						<h5>Rating: 2/5</h5>
						<br>
						<h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
						Recommendation I think the larger parts of the project should have some sort of versioning controls and getting the bare bones of the project running should be the main priority and first versions 
						</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-12">
						<h3>To what extent do you think you contributed an equal portion of the overall project?</h3>
						
						<p>I think I added a moderated portion to the project as it may not have been used the site I made was ready to be integrated with the old system it would have allowed anyone to use it with very little training with the design being focused around ease of use and navigation. The site was also built to work on any system even if it was running windows 95 it was able to run quickly and reliability without issue 
						<br><br>
						<h5>Rating: 3.5/5</h5>
						<br>
						<h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
						Recommendation is I think that if I worked on other part of the project I would have been able to contribute more to the project and will remember this for future projects
