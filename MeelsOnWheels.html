      <h3>Whats the project?</h3>
      We picked up this project about four weeks after everyone else had already started so we
      were already at a disadvantage. not to mention the project being drastically out of date
      and using old technologies it was like trying to sort out cables for a network without
      unplugging anything. <br>
      <br>
      The project was supposed to be an easy system to allow admins to enter customer data in
      and show what that customer had ordered and when they wanted it delivered it even featured an
      integrated map that allowed the admin to see who the closest driver was to the drop off
      location. </div>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p> In the end we had just fixed most of the previous errors and changed all the Agile code to Java
        this still wasn't enough for release we even had a whole new site in the making. with a fresh modern
        look that was user friendly and responsive <br>
        <br>
        unfortunately we ran out of time and did not get to integrate the new site which is what I primarily worked on the site was added to the git repository so that hopefully a future team can take over and finish what was left of our work. <br>
        <br>
        All in all, I feel we did a great job considering out circumstances and issues we had along the way
        I really enjoyed working with the team I had and hope to work with them again in the future the next
        project will be completed. </p>

    <h3>How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</h3>
    We never had any group meetings outside of class maybe this might have helped us in finishing the project since one of the biggest issues we had was working out what we were supposed to be happening. <br>
    <br>
    We often had a quick scrum when we met up in class but as far as meetings went that was it. <br>

    <h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
    By using slack we ended up communicating better and were able to work out what each of us were doing. </div>
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <h3>How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?</h3>
    Very well we had a slack channel open from the start and id always try and get around to everyone in the group to see what was happening and what had been done, also to show them the progress I had made on the new site layout we did pretty well for communications. Even though we weren’t always sure on what we were supposed to be doing <br>
    <br>
    <h5>Rating: 4/5</h5>
    <br>
    <h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
    Improvements could include having more conversations in real life rather than just online chat channels next project I will be doing more of that </div>
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <h3>How well did you document your work throughout the project?</h3>
    After each class Id usually make a quick voice to text memo on my phone this was helpful in creating the portfolio at the end although if I had just done the portfolio from the start it would have saved me much more time. I also had notes on scraps of paper that seem to have disintegrated at the bottom of my bag. We did have a Trello bored that we used to track some of the big tasks. <br>
    <br>
    <h5>Rating: 3/5</h5>
    <br>
    <h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
    Some improvements could be documenting everything from the start and rather than scraps of paper lying around just add them to a notes section of the Trello bored </div>
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <h3>How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements?</h3>
    At the start not well, when we got told we had to decipher and fix a whole heap of bugs and issues none of us were happy about it especially because we had just lost four weeks because of a client that refused to respond to any communications.  We wanted to just start the project from scratch with a clean plate which I still believe would have been easier but instead were tasked to fix and repair the non-functioning old system that was significantly out of date and using technologies we had not been trained to use. After the first half of the semester we got better with handling problems and opted to fix them straight away rather than leave them for later. <br>
    <br>

    <h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
    Some improvements for me would be entering a project with an open mind but due to the issues we faced it wasn’t entirely under our control </div>

        <h3>How well did you follow best practices in development?</h3>
        <p>I did my Best to follow the best practices but sometimes the best practices may not be the right practices there are several practices in the industry that tend to keep with the old way of doing things when there are much more new and modern ways to achieve these goals and they usually take less time and perform better overall <br>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>How well did you use appropriate version control?</h3>
        <p>I admit I personally didn’t do a good job at version control. But the rest of my team did you see while they were working on changing the code to java from Agile and fixing some backend errors I was tasked with making the whole new website templates so there was no need for anyone to access the work I was doing until the final stages of merging our work together. Until that stage was reached we decided it was better not to have any website versioning. <br>

        <h5>Rating: 2/5</h5>
        <br>
        <h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
        Recommendation I think the larger parts of the project should have some sort of versioning controls and getting the bare bones of the project running should be the main priority and first versions
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>To what extent do you think you contributed an equal portion of the overall project?</h3>
        <p>I think I added a moderated portion to the project as it may not have been used the site I made was ready to be integrated with the old system it would have allowed anyone to use it with very little training with the design being focused around ease of use and navigation. The site was also built to work on any system even if it was running windows 95 it was able to run quickly and reliability without issue <br>
          <br>
        <h5>Rating: 3.5/5</h5>
        <br>
        <h4>Improvement Advice</h4>
        Recommendation is I think that if I worked on other part of the project I would have been able to contribute more to the project and will remember this for future projects

        <h2>TimeLine</h2>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 1</h3>
          <p> So, first day of project with my team. to be honest I’m a little nervous about this
            but also, I’m looking forward to it. our first step is to contact the client and talk about 
            what exactly they want. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          We sent an email to the client asking to arrange a meeting, we are awaiting his response so
          this class I’m going to do some research on how to integrate databases with html
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 2</h3>
          <p> Nothing yet from the client, at this point of time we're all a bit confused and have attempted to 
            make sense of the very brief requirements of the project we must build some system or app for a 
            "buddy system" so that kids can buddy up with adults to do fun activities. straight away I knew this app
            needed good security and data encryption <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          We finely set up a slack channel for the group project, this will help us communicate with each other.
          Still no work has begun as we still haven’t been able to contact the client we have asked Aidon for his
          contact details so we can try contact him by phone.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 3</h3>
          <p> Ok so this is getting annoying now this is now week 3 and we have yet to make contact with the client we have tried calling him several times and still nothing, This is frustrating enough but we are now 3 weeks behind everyone else. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          We had to ask Aidon to try directly contact the client as we are unable to make a start. Aidon said he can give us a new project which I’m starting to really want it’s called meals on wheels and is supposed to be some sort of food delivery service for the elderly it sounds interesting enough.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 4</h3>
          <p> Aidon showed the project to me today, it looks like we will be taking over from an old group that didn’t finish it back in 2014, I took a quick look at the project files and it’s a mess. we need to learn node.js and the php is horrendous the UI is old and hard to use and the database is completely broken, not to mention the broken links and use of Agile code. this task looks massive just to fix let alone get 100% operational. I’m going to talk to the team about it since we attend different streams of class, will update on the next post. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          I talked to the team about it and there on board, although we would much rather start it from scratch rather than working out what everything does since none of it is documented. we would also need to learn node.js which is a task in itself. To be honest I’m getting nervous about this whole thing taking a quick look at the other group projects they all seem to be well in to it with webpages and database's already in the final planning stages. Aidon was not able to contact the client so we decided to change the project to meals on wheels. Aidon advised us to take the weekend to look over what was required and try and make sense of what we had.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 5</h3>
          <p> After a long and tiring weekend of trying to work out what was what with the project I decided to talk to the team about what they had discovered we all decided it would be much better to start from scratch and work hard on it. This way we knew what we were doing and didn't need to worry about researching and self-teaching ourselves how to use most of the system. we went ahead with the idea and talked to Elise an Aidon about it. by the time we got around to seeing them class was over, and half of the group had already left so I talked to them on behalf of the group. I then found out that we had little choice but to continue where the old group had finished meaning we had to lean it all. I sent out a message to the group to let them know what the new plan was, they weren’t to happy about the decision, but we went ahead. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          Another week was about to end, and we were still talking amongst ourselves weather it was a good idea to start over or continue since it was more work to learn the system than create our own one from scratch by now we had just started to learn how to get the old system operational although it barely worked in its current state we decided to work with what we had and began work with setting up jobs on a Trello board.
          I was assigned the job of redesigning the site with CSS and HTML over PHP. we chose HTML over PHP because it was quicker to implement, and we knew how to use it. We also didn’t see the need for PHP as the site did not need to be as secure since it was only for admin access and no clients should have access to it.
          </p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 6</h3>
          <p> Fresh start to a new week and I had just finished planning out what I wanted for the new design. It was a complete rebuild from the ground up that didn’t interfere with any of the other group members work. I took some screen shots of the old site and began scribbling down the final plans for the site layouts and some basic margins math for the CSS. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          After finalising the last of the plans, I showed some of the group members, from what I gathered they seemed to like it. I asked them if they had any ideas or if I had missed anything I was suggested to remove the google map system to help speed up development. I spent the rest of the day finalising the final plans on some paper.
          </p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 7</h3>
          <p> I started this week off with looking at an empty screen, it took a while to get the basic file structure setup and a very basic version of CSS running, I admit I was a little rusty on my Web design but quickly picked it up again once I started. at the end of the day i had a very basic site with some customised classes from my CSS <br>
            <br>
          <h4>Lesson 2</h4>
          Today I went looking online for some sort of custom font. The default font seemed so sharp and just didn't match at all with what I had in the templates, I ended up using my adobe membership to licence a Font for use of the group project and was sure to make sure that I licenced it for commercial use as well, for when the project is completed. I found what I needed and spent the rest of the week implementing and testing it. <br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- /.section-title -->
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Week 8</h3>
          <p> Finally, After a frustrating weekend I got the new font working without issue.  It wasn't as easy as i thought and I had to create a CSS call for each Character luckily for me there was a builder that automated this process for me saving me a lot of time. I had also made a very stupid but simple mistake of misspelling the location of my CSS document so the HTML wasn't even accessing it from the start..
            I checked up on the team and they were starting to make good progress fixing the bugs and the login screen was almost fixed. I began the main section of development for the Site. by adding the required sections to create some sort of basic site Template. so, we could use the same page template rather than writing a new one each time. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          Parallax that’s what I added it was like a moving image in the background. Ok I admit I got side-tracked and was getting in to this a tad too much. But I wanted someone to look at this site and say "Wow", I've seen so many work sites that have the same boring work look that really makes the job feel so much more depressing looking at plain text words all day. So, in an effort to make the site look and feel more user friendly I justified my work. the good news is the site looks clean and modern without all these menus crowding up the page and "over complicating" things.
          </p>

          <h3>Week 9</h3>
          <p> This Week was all about Structure building the website with the bare bones was now done it was time to add some colour I started with a light blue and cream white theme it looked great, so I stuck with it. Then by mistake I made the screen small and noticed I had forgotten a very important step. Responsiveness all my work with divs and boxes had now reduced to a jumble of mess with paragraphs of Lorem Ispsim spreading throughout the sections of the site like some out of control virus. It was but a mess of colours. It was good timing too because one of my group members came over to see how the site was going to see the mess it was in. As for the rest of the team they were working hard on trying to change the Agile code to Java script code, so I quickly made a new folder for JavaScript and implemented some functions to allow calling of the Google Maps section.
            <!-- add picture example of the map code -->
            <br>
            <br>
          <h4>lesson 2</h4>
          <br>
          I worked hard over the Wednesday to Fix the Site and get it working on not only desktops but Tablets and mobile too as I wasn't completely sure what kind of device the admins may use or want to use in the future it wasn't completely fixed yet so I spent most of this lesson working on getting that fixed.

          <h3>Week 10</h3>
          <p> Week 10 had arrived, and holidays were right around the corner we had only just started now on actually adding content to the project now that most of the bugs were fixed and it was now running semi stability the login screen had now been fixed and there was no more Agile code in the project. As for how the website was going I had finally fixed the responsiveness and added a call to a to use a Legacy way to make the site work as well as I again wasn’t sure if the client should be using HTML 5 compatible browsers or not. either way the site was working and i was nearing the final stages of the development with it <br>
            <br>
          <h4>lesson 2</h4>
          Time for a bit of bootstrap. I created a new CSS document to help keep the Bootstrap and Main CSS separate for easier readability. It was easier than I thought to implement with the latest version of bootstrap it was quick Job that took only one lesson to complete. With that done It was time to head off home for a 2 week "break". <br>

          <h3>Week 11</h3>
          <p> Freshly Back or so I was supposed to be I ended up working on my own work for most of the holidays and spent most of my days learning new skills and refreshing others but enough about that. We didn’t talk about the project at all in the holidays in hindsight maybe we should have but we learnt that lesson, I booted up the website again and took a look at what I had done to see where I was up too while looking at the site I realised I had forgotten to add any navigation to the site I added a navigation bar and attached it to the top. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>lesson 2</h4>
          The navigation bar was still giving me troubles for some reason it would not reach the entire length of the screen. It wasn’t a huge problem but it was there and once you saw it you couldn't un-see it became my priority for the rest of this week. <br>

          <h3>Week 12</h3>
          <p> I gave up on the navigation thing it was just taking far too long to fix this simple error and it just wasn’t working. Work from other classes had started to pile up now so I found myself with less and less time to complete the Website. It was basically done it was responsive and was really easy to use I added a quick search bar to the top navigation so if the Admins needed to search the tables for a specific client they only needed to type it in to the search bar. I opted for Dropdown navigation menus to keep the Page clear for content. this gave a clean look to the page. I also added some input to the Database by creating some fake data with a data generator I built back in DB2 this allowed me to see what happened when We had over 1000 clients the current site was much slower and wasn't made to handle more than 10 clients at a time, so I help fix this issue when we found the time. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>lesson 2</h4>
          With the databases working and the site now finished it was time to implement it that was the big part. I talked to the team but due to miscommunication the Site wasn't implemented and was all the way down the schedule. To be honest I don’t think the team really knew that we were going to port the whole thing to the new site. I helped out with some small touch up such as commenting etc. <br>

          <h3>Week 13</h3>
          <p> This week I spent most of the time code cleaning it was a bit of a mess and I decide to try cleaning it up a bit alongside commenting all the work I had done on the site. we had pretty much completed all the tasks on the Tello board at this time and went to sure where or what to do next. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>lesson 2</h4>
          At this Point I talked to the group and the general consensus was "I don’t know what I’m doing really" I believe this was due to a lot of issues we had at the start of the project and bad planning. it turns out most of the hard work only got added to the project after the semester break. Maybe if we went in knowing what and how to use this system we would have had more of a chance of completing it. I’m not saying we didn't get anything done we got a lot done and fixed and I’m pretty proud of my website. but it’s just sad that it probably won’t be implemented meaning for now my work won’t be seen. <br>

          <h3>Week 14</h3>
          <p> I have to admit not much really happened this week we looked at implementing data tables and I showed everyone in the group the new site, No one had really seen it since it was in its "broken" state they were impressed at the changes that had been made of course it had to be manually merged since it used html over the php that was already in the project. Of course, there was the small issue with me being on my own fork of the github so no one was seeing the progress I was making it was easy to merge to the master since I specifically created the Folders to not interfere with any of the previous project files already on the branch. this week was all about cleaning up and commenting. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>lesson 2</h4>
          It occurs to me now that we should have started implementing the site mid development but too late now, the Site is sitting there ready to be merged templates are all set with fully commented code and even a small note/Readme explaining what was done and what was needed for the implementation this is here for the next group that takes over. If it ever is completed hopefully they keep the site template I worked so hard on.
          With one week left before this is due I’m not sure what to do. <br>

          <h3>Week 15</h3>
          <p> The Last week for this project has arrived the site is sitting there dormant while we pull and test the current build We had a few issues with the adding of a new customer, but it turned out we were just running an old version again due to a git Forking issue. <br>
            <br>
          <h4>lesson 2</h4>
          Everything seems to be working the code looking a lot nicer than what we started with as this is the last week before the due date the next post will be more of a reflection than anything. nothing was done but check over code and make sure things were working today. <br>

          <h3>Week 16</h3>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p> Even though this is reflected in my essay I thought I’d add a summarised reflection here. As the semester comes to a close and the project comes to an end I feel somewhat sad that it wasn’t completely finished we faced a lot of issues over this semester from having no client and being given a project that not even the original team knew what was truly going on. <br>
            We faced a lot of issues and fought each one as a team. We may not have finished the project and may not have had any real lessons in this class but I find it was also one of the most valuable class's I have ever been in. The environment was very much like the real world we had no specific rules and we had to rely on others to get passed certain tasks. <br>
            Looking back on this semester I definitely have learnt a fair amount about how to work in a team and how essential team communication is. There were several things that my gut instinct told me to do but being put in the situation of having no idea of where to start or what was what was truly the best way to experiences what a bad project is like. I feel that this would be a challenge for even people already in the workforce with learning new technologies accompanied by the strict timeline broken system and little information to work with. <br>
            Overall I’m happy with what we achieved as a team even if the project wasn't fully completed I fell that we achieved more overall and the skills that we picked up along the way are invaluable. </p>
